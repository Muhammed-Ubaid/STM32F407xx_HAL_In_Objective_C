# STM32F407xx_HAL_In_Objective_C
This project provides for drivers and HAL designed on objective C principles for GPIOs, ADC, PWM, Timers, SPI, I2C, UART, RTC &amp; Low Power Mode for STM32F407xx discovery board.

.h files demonstrate abstraction and structures based attributes encapsulation in C.
.c files demonstrate method encapsulation along with public and private access specifiers.
Polymorphism is also demonstrated in C through void pointers.
Inheritance in C is demonstrated through various .c files.
